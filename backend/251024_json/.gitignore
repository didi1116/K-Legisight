# .gitignore — generated template
# Add directories or files (one per line) that you don't want Git to track.
# Examples:
#   build/
#   output/
#   data/
#   /absolute/path/from-repo-root/

# Common entries
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*.egg-info/
dist/

# ----- REPLACE the following line(s) with the folder(s) you want to ignore -----
# Example: if you want to ignore a folder named `myfolder` at the repository root,
# add a line `myfolder/` (trailing slash indicates a directory).
REPLACE_WITH_FOLDER/

# If that folder is already tracked by Git, untrack it with:
#   git rm -r --cached REPLACE_WITH_FOLDER
#   git add .
#   git commit -m "Ignore REPLACE_WITH_FOLDER"
